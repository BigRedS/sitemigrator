sitemigrator
============

Sitemigrator is a script for migrating a bunch of sites from one host
to another. It reads two files, one of which contains a list of sites
to migrate and the other defining the parameters to operate on, 
including things like MySQL credentials and file paths for bits of the
sites that need migrating.

Currently it only dumps-and-inserts MySQL dbs and rsyncs homedirs, since
that's all I've yet needed it to do. It'll deal with apache config in the 
future.
