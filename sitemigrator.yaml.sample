# This is a YAML file. It has two annoying rules:
#  - It must have a line of three hyphens at the beginning
#  - Line indentation _must_ be spaces and not tabs.
#
# There are sensible defaults for most settings; run the script with 
# no config file to find out what they are. Config here is illustrative
# example, not default, so delete any lines where you don't need to change 
# the defaults.
# You may not pass null for any option with a default.
